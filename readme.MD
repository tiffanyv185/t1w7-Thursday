# Advance Data Types

## Lists
- they are ordered, mutable (changeable, can add, replace or remove) collection of items.
- They are defined by enclosing elements in square brackets.
- Example: fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

## Tuples
- They are ordered, immutable (unchangeable, cannot add, replace or remove) collection of items.
- They are defined by enclosing elements in parenthesis / small brackets ().

## Sets
-  They are unordered collection of unique elements (cannot have identical elements).
- They are useful for membership testing, removing duplicates from a sequence, and mathematical operations like union, intersection and difference.
- Cannot access elements using index operator []. Need to check if the elements exists in the set.
- They are defined by enclosing elements in curly braces {}

## Dictionaries
- A collection of key value pairs, muteable
- Each key value is unique and they keys re used to store and retrieve values.
